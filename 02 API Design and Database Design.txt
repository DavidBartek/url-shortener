API Design

create endpoint for each functional requirement:
1. URL Shortening

POST /api/urls/shorten
Req: Long URL
Res: Short URL

2. URL Redirection

GET /api/urls/{shortUrl} (best way to pass in, as GET has no body)
Res: Redirect 302
// 300-level is redirect
// 301: browser saves this redirect to cache (no analytics)
// 302: browser does NOT cache redirect (supports analytics)
